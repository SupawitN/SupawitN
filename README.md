You can call me New or Supawit. Nguansamang is my Thai last name.

I was a teacher at a public school in Bangkok, Thailand. My previous work was about teaching Japanese language and culture for Thailand's high school students who learn Japanese as a second foreign languange, supporting students, and managing human resources. My current interests are interpretation and translation works.
